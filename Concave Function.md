see [[Convex Function]]
- concave function is one for which the function value at any [[Convex Combination]] of elements in the domain is greater than or equal to that convex combination of those domain elements
- function for which the [[hypograph]] is convex.
- class of concave functions is in a sense the opposite of the class of convex functions
- synonymously called concave downwards, concave down, convex upwards, convex cap, or upper convex.
- f is concave $\iff$ −f is convex.

A real-valued function on an interval or, more generally, a [[convex]] set in [[vector space]])
**concave** if, for any x and y in the interval and for an $\alpha \in [0,1]$
	$f((1-\alpha )x+\alpha y)\geq (1-\alpha )f(x)+\alpha f(y)$
	
A function is called **strictly concave** if
	$f((1-\alpha )x+\alpha y)>(1-\alpha )f(x)+\alpha f(y)$
for any $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and $x\neq y$
