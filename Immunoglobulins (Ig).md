[[Antibody]] proteins produced by [[B-cells]] / plasma cells that specifically recognize and bind [[Antigens]].

 - Identify pathogens or toxins and mediate their elimination.

Core features:
- Structure: Y-shaped molecules with
- Variable regions (Fab) → antigen binding
- Constant region (Fc) → effector functions (Fc receptor binding, complement activation)
- Specificity: Each immunoglobulin binds a particular [[Epitope]].

Major classes (isotypes):
- IgG: Most abundant in blood; opsonization, neutralization, complement activation; crosses placenta.
- IgA: Mucosal immunity; found in saliva, tears, breast milk.
- IgM: First antibody produced in an immune response; strong complement activator.
- IgE: Allergy and parasite defense; binds mast cells and basophils.
- IgD: Primarily a B-cell receptor; regulatory role.

Key roles:
- Neutralization of viruses and toxins
- Opsonization (tagging for phagocytosis)
- Complement activation
- Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)
