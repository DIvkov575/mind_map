**Transcriptomics** is the study of the **transcriptome**: the complete set of RNA transcripts produced by a cell, tissue, or organism at a given time and condition.
- **[[mRNA]] levels** (gene expression)
- Often also **non-coding RNAs** (lncRNA, miRNA, etc.)
- Captures **which genes are active** and **how strongly** they are expressed

**Main Methods**
- [[RNA-seq]]
- [[Microarrays]]
