- a type of [[Automorphism]] of [[Schwartz Space]] $F:S(R_n)⟷S(R_n)$ (not true for other function spaces)
	- Two fundamental identitiesL set of functions stable under:
		- arbitrary differentiation
		- arbitrary multiplication by polynomials
	- Those operations are dual under Fourier transform. No other common space has this symmetry.
