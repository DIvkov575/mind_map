- flow formalizes the idea of the motion of particles in a fluid.
- flow is a [[Group Actions]] of the real numbers on a set
- Vector flow is idea of flow determined by [[vector field]]
- Examples: [[Geodesic Flow]], [[Hamilton Flow]], [[Ricci Flow]], [[Mean Curvature Flow]], [[Anosov Flow

- A **flow** typically refers to a **family of transformations** that describe how points move in a space over time, often generated by a differential equation.
- **[[Flow Map]]** is the **actual map** corresponding to a specific time t in the flow:
		$F_t: x \mapsto \phi_t(x)$
	- It is just the “snapshot” of the flow at a fixed time.
	- If the flow is continuous in time, the flow map for each ttt gives a diffeomorphism (smooth invertible map) of the space under the dynamics.
    

#### Definition
$\displaystyle \varphi :X\times \mathbb {R} \to X$
such that, for all _x_ ∈ _X_ and all real numbers s and t,
![{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\varphi (x,0)=x;\\&\varphi (\varphi (x,t),s)=\varphi (x,s+t).\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06031f823a095555a3273294cf55edc0eb29f80f)

Given x in X, the set ![{\displaystyle \{\varphi (x,t):t\in \mathbb {R} \}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c2945076cac300d052b82c02007c34d757e35728) is called the orbit of x under φ. Informally, it may be regarded as the trajectory of a particle that was initially positioned at x.
