An **SNP** is a **Single Nucleotide Polymorphism**. It’s the most common type of genetic variation in humans.
- A **single base pair** in the DNA sequence that varies between individuals.
- Most SNPs are **bi-allelic** (two possible alleles, e.g., A or G).
- They occur roughly **once every 300 nucleotides**, so there are millions in the human genome.
- Many SNPs are **neutral** (no effect), but some affect gene function or disease risk.
