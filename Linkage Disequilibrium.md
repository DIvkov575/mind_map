Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is the non-random association of alleles at different [[Loci]] in a population.

LD arises because:
1. **Physical proximity**: SNPs close on a chromosome are inherited together.
	1. Deadahh just this <<
2. [[Limited recombination]]: recombination breaks associations slowly.
3. **Population history**: [[bottlenecks]], [[bottlenecks|founder effects]], [[admixture]], [[genetic drift]]
4. **Selection**: favorable alleles drag neighbors with them (hitchhiking).
LD decays with **genetic distance**, not just physical distance.
