[[Bacteria]] with a natural intracellular magnetic chain
- can sense and orient themselves along **magnetic fields**.
- Magnetotactic organisms produce intracellular structures called agnetosomes which are membrane-bound crystals of magnetic minerals (typically magnetite, Fe₃O₄, or greigite, Fe₃S₄).
- This allows the organism to align with Earth’s magnetic field and navigate efficiently, usually to reach optimal oxygen concentration zones
- Magnetotaxis = movement guided by magnetic fields.
