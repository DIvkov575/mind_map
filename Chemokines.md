[[Cytokines]] that direct cell migration ([[chemotaxis]]), especially of immune cells, by forming concentration gradient

Key points:
- Function: Guide immune cells to sites of infection, inflammation, or tissue damage.
- Size/structure: ~8–12 kDa proteins with [[Conserved motifs | conserved]] [[cysteine]] motifs.
- Mechanism: Bind G-protein–coupled chemokine receptors ([[GPCR]]s) on target cells → [[cytoskeletal\\ rearrangement and directed movement.

Major families (defined by cysteine arrangement):

- CC: Two adjacent cysteines (e.g., CCL2) → monocytes, T cells.

- CXC: One amino acid between cysteines (e.g., CXCL8/IL-8) → neutrophils.

- CX3C: Three amino acids between cysteines (CX3CL1/fractalkine).
- XC: One cysteine (XCL1).
