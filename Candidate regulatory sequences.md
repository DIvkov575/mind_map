**Candidate regulatory sequences** are genomic DNA segments predicted to have a regulatory function—i.e., they likely control when, where, and how strongly genes are expressed—but have not yet been definitively validated experimentally.

### Common types
Candidate regulatory sequences typically include:
- **Promoters** – near transcription start sites; recruit RNA polymerase.
- **Enhancers** – distal elements that increase transcription, often cell-type specific.
- **Silencers** – repress gene expression.
- **Insulators / boundary elements** – block enhancer–promoter interactions or define chromatin domains.
- **UTR regulatory elements** – affect [[mRNA]] stability or translation (post-transcriptional).
