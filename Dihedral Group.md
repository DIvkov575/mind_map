[[Group Actions]]

- group of symmetries of a regular polygon, which includes rotations and reflections.
- among simplest of [[Finite group]]s
- Consists of
	- n rotational symmetries
	- n reflection symmetries

- (Geometry) $D_n$ or $Dih_n$ - refers to symmetries of [[n-gon]] a group of order 2n
- (Algebra) $D_{2n}$ - refers to the same dihedral group
