morphism is a structure-preserving map between two objects of the same kind

**General ([[category theory]]) definition**

- A morphism$f : A \to B$ is an arrow from object A to object B.
- Morphisms can be **composed**: if f:f : A \to B and g : B \to C, then g \circ f : A \to C.
- Each object A has an **identity morphism** \mathrm{id}_A : A \to A.

**Common examples**
- **Sets**: morphisms are functions f:A→Bf : A \to Bf:A→B.
- **Groups**: morphisms are group homomorphisms (preserve the group operation).
- **Rings**: morphisms are ring homomorphisms.
- **Vector spaces**: morphisms are linear maps.
- **Topological spaces**: morphisms are continuous maps.
- **Posets** (as categories): morphisms correspond to order relations x≤yx \le yx≤y.
