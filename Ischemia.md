Ischemia is a condition in which tissue receives insufficient blood flow, leading to reduced oxygen and nutrient delivery and impaired removal of metabolic waste.

Core points:
- Mechanism: Usually caused by arterial obstruction/narrowing 
	- (e.g., [[thrombosis]], [[embolism]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[vasospasm]]).
- Immediate effect: Hypoxia → impaired [[oxidative metabolism]] → ATP depletion.
- Cellular consequences: Switch to anaerobic glycolysis, lactic acidosis, ion pump failure, cell swelling; prolonged ischemia -> irreversible injury/necrosis (uncontrolled cell death)

[[Reperfusion injury]] (key concept):
- Restoration of blood flow can paradoxically worsen injury via [[ROS generation]], [[calcium overload]], inflammation, and endothelial damage.
