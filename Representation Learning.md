aka Feature Learning
techniques that allow a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data.

### Types
- Embeddings
- Feature Maps
- Latent Variables

### Techniques
**Supervised
 - Neural Networks
 - MLPs
 - [[Dictionary Learning]]
**Unsupervised**
- [[Clustering]]
- [[Dictionary Learning]]
- [[Independent Component Analysis]]
- [[Matrix Factorization]]
- [[Locally Linear Embedding]]
**Self-Supervised Learning**
- [[Auto Encoder]]
- [[Boltzmann machine | RBM]] can be viewed as a single layer architecture for unsupervised feature learning. In particular, the visible variables correspond to input data, and the hidden variables correspond to feature detectors. The weights can be trained by maximizing the probability of visible variables using [[Hinton's Contrastive Divergence (CD)]] Learning Algorithm
