<u>Def</u> A (strong) composition of $n \in \mathbb{N} \backslash \{0\}$ with j parts is a solution to $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_j = n$ such that $X_i \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$
- in other words, a set of distinct non-zero [[Ordered Set Partition | partition]] sizes which add up to n

<u>Def</u> A (weak) composition ... such that $x_i \in \mathbb{N} (\ni 0)$
