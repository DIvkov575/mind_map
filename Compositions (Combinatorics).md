<u>Def</u> A (strong) composition of $n \in \mathbb{N} \backslash \{0\}$ with j parts is a solution to $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_j = n$ such that $X_i \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$
- in other words, a set of distinct non-zero [[Ordered Set Partition | partition]] sizes which add up to n
- $\boxed{\#\{\text{strong compositions of } n\} = 2^{n-1}}$
	- <u>proof</u>  think of $1_1, 1_2, \ldots, 1_n$  seperated by n-1 seperators. We can retain/remove seperators in $2^{n-1}$ ways
- A strong composition of n into k parts is a solution of $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = n \quad \text{with } x_i \ge 1$ and by [[Stars and Bars]] $\boxed{\binom{n-1}{k-1}}$


<u>Def</u> A (weak) composition ... such that $x_i \in \mathbb{N} (\ni 0)$
