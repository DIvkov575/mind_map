 A wavelet is a wave like oscillation where amplitude begins at zero, increases, returns to zero.
If this wavelet were to be [[convolution | convolved]] with a signal created from the recording of a melody, then the resulting signal would be useful for determining when the middle C note appeared in the song.
- sets of complementary wavelets are useful in [[wavelet-base compression]] algorithms
