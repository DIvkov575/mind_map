Distributed ML paradigm
- Distributed client datasets ([[Pooling (datasets)]]) 
- Model trained locally on clients, federated and aggregated gradients @ server, model redistributed for several "rounds"

Implementations (such as NVIDIA FLARE) ensure:
- [[Differential Privacy]]
- [[Homomorphic Encryption]]
