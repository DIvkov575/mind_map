Frame of an [[inner-product space]] is a generalization of a basis (of a vector space) to sets that may be linearly dependent.
- (Signal processing) Provides a redundant robust way of representing a signal 
	- Each axis (a [[wavelet]] / function / filter) may be correlated
- Used in [[error-correction codes]] and error detection and the design of [[filter banks]]
