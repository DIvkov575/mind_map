small, secreted cell-signaling proteins that regulate immune responses, [[inflammation]], [[hematopoiesis]], and cell communication.


- cell comunication example...?

Core properties:
- Produced by: [[Immune cells]] (e.g., T cells, macrophages) and many non-immune cells.
- Act locally (paracrine/autocrine) or systemically.
- Low concentrations, high biological potency.
Main functions:
- Coordinate immune activation and suppression
- Control cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival
- Mediate inflammation and tissue repair

Major classes:

- [[Interleukins (IL-)]]: Communication between leukocytes (e.g., IL-2, IL-6).
- [[Interferons (IFN-)]]: Antiviral and immunomodulatory (e.g., IFN-α, IFN-γ).
- [[Tumor necrosis factors (TNF)]]: Inflammation, apoptosis (e.g., TNF-α).
- [[Chemokines]]: Direct cell migration (a functional subset of cytokines).
- [[Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs)]]: Stimulate blood cell production.

Key characteristics:
- Pleiotropy: One cytokine has multiple effects.
- Redundancy: Different cytokines can produce similar effects.
- Synergy/antagonism: Cytokines interact to amplify or inhibit responses.
