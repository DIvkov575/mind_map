- generalization of [[Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN)]]
- WNs are one hidden layer networks that use a [[Wavelet]] as an [[[Activation Function]], instead of the classic sigmoidal family
- multidimensional wavelets preserve the “[[Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT)| universal approximation]]” property that characterizes NNs

- With [[Wavelet Decomposition]] a "wavelet library" can be built
- Each [[Wavelon]] (node within WN) can be constructed as best wavelet from our wavelet library
