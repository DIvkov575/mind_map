$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n (x - c)^n$$
- an​ are coefficients.
- c is the **center** of the series.
- x is the variable.


We want to know if this series converges?
- convergence => if you plug x (from [[Radius of Convergence]]) the infinite sum actually adds up to a real number
- Radius of Convergence -> the set of X which make the series converge to finite number
