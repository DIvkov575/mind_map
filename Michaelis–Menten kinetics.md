simplest case of [[enzyme kinetics]], applied to enzyme-catalysed reactions involving the transformation of one substrate into one product

$v$ (rate of formation of product P, with concentration  $p$ as a function of $a$ the concentration of the substrate A (using the symbols recommended by the IUBMB). The formula below is given by the Michaelis–Menten equation:
$$\displaystyle v={\frac {\mathrm {d} p}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\frac {Va}{K_{\mathrm {m} }+a}}$$
