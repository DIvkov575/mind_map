machine learning regularization technique that halts model training when its performance on a separate validation dataset stops improving, or starts degrading, preventing [[Fitting | overfitting]]
- **Patience-based Early Stopping:** Monitor validation loss and stop training if it does not improve for a set number of consecutive epochs (patience).
- Minimum delta for validation loss
