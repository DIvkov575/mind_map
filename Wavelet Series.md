**wavelet series** is a representation of a square integrable real or complex valued function by a certain orthonormal series generated by a [[Wavelet]]
- with respect to complete orthonormal basis functions
- with overcomplete set or [[frame (vector space)]] for the [[Hilbert Space]] of square integrable functions.
	- Accomplished with [[coherent states]]
