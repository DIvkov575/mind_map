An **automorphism** is an isomorphism from a mathematical object to itself.

Formally, if X is an object in some category (e.g., a group, vector space, graph, topological space), an automorphism is a bijective structure-preserving map

$f : X \to X$

whose inverse is also structure-preserving.

What “structure-preserving” means depends on the context:

- **Group automorphism**: a bijection f:G→Gf: G \to Gf:G→G such that
    
    f(xy)=f(x)f(y)f(xy) = f(x)f(y)f(xy)=f(x)f(y)
- **Vector space automorphism**: an invertible linear map T:V→VT: V \to VT:V→V
    
- **Ring automorphism**: a bijection preserving addition and multiplication
    
- **Graph automorphism**: a permutation of vertices preserving adjacency
    
- **Topological automorphism (homeomorphism)**: a continuous bijection with continuous inverse
