focuses on estimating **cause-and-effect relationships** rather than just correlations

[[Counterfactual Framework]] Compare Y under treatment vs. no treatment, even though only one is observed (counterfactual).

[[Structural Causal Models (SCMs)]] Model causal relationships explicitly using a graph (DAG) and structural equations.

[[Causal Forests]] Estimate heterogeneous treatment effects $(\tau(x))$ for different covariates based on splitting rules that maximize treatment effect heterogeneity.

[[Uplift Modeling]] Predict which individuals respond positively to interventions.
